Version 0.4.5:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fixes the install target in Makefile.in.

Version 0.4.4:
	- Removes pre-generated Doxygen documentation.
	- Minor updates to Makefile.in for compatibility with Debian packaging.

Version 0.4.3:
    New features:
    - Support for highlighting C++11 raw string literals.
	- Support for Ruby highlighting.

    Bug fixes:
    - Properly handle Emacs mode lines. Only the first character of the
      language name was used to detect the highlighting mode.
	- Fix javascript regular expression literal highlighting to accept
	  expressions starting with \ or [,. Also allow such literals after
	  detecting a comma.

Version 0.4.2:
	Re-release of version 0.4.0 for config script update.

Version 0.4.1:
	Re-release of version 0.4.0 for config script update.

Version 0.4.0:
	New features:
	- The interface for detection of languages was changed to return a
	  t3_highlight_lang_t struct, to allow accurate loading of the patterns
	  from the detected language.
	- A new function was added to retrieve the language detected from the
	  file name.
	- Basic syntax highlighting patterns for PHP. Currently does not include
	  highlighting of string interpolation.

	Bug fixes:
	- The HTML patterns for the svg, math and style tags did not correctly
	  accept the generic HTML attribute names.
	- The style tag was not colored correctly at all.

	This version is both an API and ABI break.

Version 0.3.5:
	Bug fixes:
	- Added omitted 'do' keyword for C++.
	- Fix reads and writes of unallocated memory in analyzing patterns.

Version 0.3.4:
	Bug fixes:
	- Add override keyword for C++.
	- Update the diff language spec to be more permissive.
	- Correct color for deletions in t3highlight when outputing to terminal.

Version 0.3.3:
	Bug fixes:
	- Loop check in matching checked the end of the previoius match instead of
	  the end of the newly found match, causing the check to be too
	  conservative.
	- The shell pattern was missing the elif keyword.
	- The java pattern did not highlight string constants, even though they were
	  being recognised.

Version 0.3.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- The shell patterns were updated to correctly exit from subshells and other
	  constructs using the closing parenthesis as their terminator.

Version 0.3.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix incorrect analysis of on-entry states, which would allow a loop of
	  empty start patterns, when more than one on-entry pattern was used in a
	  single pattern.

Version 0.3.0:
	New features:
	- Start patterns for states may now match the empty string, provided they
	  do not cause a cycle of states reachable through only empty-string
	  matches.

	Bug fixes:
	- The shell patterns have been improved to recognize keywords better.

Version 0.2.4:
	Bug fixes:
	- Compile with Large File Support if such support is available on the
	  platform.

Version 0.2.3:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix memory leak in t3_highlight_detect.

Version 0.2.2:
	New features:
	- Added LaTeX output option for t3highlight program.

	Bug fixes:
	- Fix missing casts to unsigned char in UTF-8 validity check.

Version 0.2.1:
	New features:
	- A new API for autodetection of languages using either the vi(m) modelines
	  and Emacs major mode comments, or the interpreter for scripts.
	- Switch to XDG Base Directory Specification locations for per-user
	  configuration files.

Version 0.2.0:
	New features:
	- Added dynamic 'end' patterns, which allows the 'end' pattern to be
	  dependent on the text matched by the 'start' pattern.
	- Allowed 'end' and other patterns to specify how many states to exit. This
	  also allows multiple 'end'-like patterns and error patterns.
	- Added the possibility to push extra states on the stack on matching a
	  'start' pattern. This allows more state based handling of the input.
	- Added perl language definition.
	- Added HTML language definition.
	- Added CSS language definition.
	- Added MathML language definition.
	- Added SVG language definition.
	- Updated C language definition to C11 standard.
	- Improved the handling of here-docs in the shell language.
	- Implemented internal UTF-8 validity check, such that pcre_exec can be
	  called with PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK. This increases performance.
	- Changed the matching routine to use anchored matching, to speed up the
	  matching process. As a result, the \G assertion matches everywhere, and
	  is therefore rendered useless. This results in a large (>10 times)
	  speed-up.
	- Added t3highlight executable, which allows using the highlighter from the
	  command line. Different output styles can be used, with styles for
	  terminal output (esc) and HTML included.
	- Added verbose error reporting.

	Bug fixes:
	- Don't use \b to determine word boundaries when - is also a word character.

Version 0.1.3:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix memory leak in loading available names.

Version 0.1.2:
	New features:
	- Added python and python3 language definitions.

	Bug fixes:
	- Improved floating point constant matching for Java and C/C++.
	- Use longest match instead of first match as tie breaker.

Version 0.1.1:
	Initial release
