Version 0.2.2:
	New features:
	- Added LaTeX output option for t3highlight program.

	Bug fixes:
	- Fix missing casts to unsigned char in UTF-8 validity check.

Version 0.2.1:
	New features:
	- A new API for autodetection of languages using either the vi(m) modelines
	  and Emacs major mode comments, or the interpreter for scripts.
	- Switch to XDG Base Directory Specification locations for per-user
	  configuration files.

Version 0.2.0:
	New features:
	- Added dynamic 'end' patterns, which allows the 'end' pattern to be
	  dependent on the text matched by the 'start' pattern.
	- Allowed 'end' and other patterns to specify how many states to exit. This
	  also allows multiple 'end'-like patterns and error patterns.
	- Added the possibility to push extra states on the stack on matching a
	  'start' pattern. This allows more state based handling of the input.
	- Added perl language definition.
	- Added HTML language definition.
	- Added CSS language definition.
	- Added MathML language definition.
	- Added SVG language definition.
	- Updated C language definition to C11 standard.
	- Improved the handling of here-docs in the shell language.
	- Implemented internal UTF-8 validity check, such that pcre_exec can be
	  called with PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK. This increases performance.
	- Changed the matching routine to use anchored matching, to speed up the
	  matching process. As a result, the \G assertion matches everywhere, and
	  is therefore rendered useless. This results in a large (>10 times)
	  speed-up.
	- Added t3highlight executable, which allows using the highlighter from the
	  command line. Different output styles can be used, with styles for
	  terminal output (esc) and HTML included.
	- Added verbose error reporting.

	Bug fixes:
	- Don't use \b to determine word boundaries when - is also a word character.

Version 0.1.3:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix memory leak in loading available names.

Version 0.1.2:
	New features:
	- Added python and python3 language definitions.

	Bug fixes:
	- Improved floating point constant matching for Java and C/C++.
	- Use longest match instead of first match as tie breaker.

Version 0.1.1:
	Initial release
