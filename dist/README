Introduction
============

The libt3highlight library provides functions for syntax highlighting different
types of text files.

libt3highlight is part of the Tilde Terminal Toolkit (T3)
[http://os.ghalkes.nl/t3/]

libt3highlight is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. See
the file COPYING for details.


Prerequisites and installation
==============================

libt3highlight requires the GNU libtool utility to be compiled. Furthermore, it
requires libpcre and libt3config.

There are two ways in which to compile libt3highlight:

Using the configure script:
---

$ ./configure
or
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
(see ./configure --help for more tuning options)
$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

Manually editing the Makefile to suit your computer:
---

$ cp Makefile.in Makefile

Edit the values for the different variables, using the comments in the
Makefile for guidance, to suit your environment.

$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

The Makefiles in the distribution should work on all POSIX compatible make's.
They have been tested using both GNU make and BSD make.


Reporting bugs
==============

If you think you have found a bug, please check that you are using the latest
version of libt3highlight [http://os.ghalkes.nl/t3/libt3highlight.html]. When
reporting bugs, please include a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.
