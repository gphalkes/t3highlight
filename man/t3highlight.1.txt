NAME
====

t3highlight - create syntax highlighted document from source file.

SYNOPSIS
========

t3highlight [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
===========

t3highlight reads a source file and creates a syntax highlighted document
from it.

OPTIONS
=======

t3highlight accepts the following options:

*-d*  _type_, *--document-type*=_type_::
  For styles which define multiple document types, select a specific type
  instead of the default. For example, the _html_ style supplied with
  t3highlight provides the _standalone_, _separate-css_ and
  _raw_ styles. By default the first (_standalone_) is chosen. See the
  *-D*/*--list-document-types* option for finding out the
  available document types.
*-D*, *--list-document-types*::
  Show a list of the available document types for the selected output style, and
  exit.
*-l* _lang_, *--language*=_lang_::
  Use source language _lang_ for highlighting. See the *-L*/*--list*
  option for finding out the available languages.
*--language-file*=_file_::
  Use the file _file_ for highlighting. This option allows loading of
  highlighting patterns directly from a file, rather than using a named language
  from the lang.map file. This is particularly useful when developing new
  highlighting patterns.
*-L*, *--list*::
  Show a list of all the available source languages and output styles, and exit.
*-s* _style_, *--style*=_style_::
  Use output style _style_ to create the output document. The default is the
  _esc_ style, which uses escape sequences to provide colored output to the
  terminal. See the *-L*/*--list* option for finding out the
  available styles.
*-t* _tag_, *--tag*=_tag_::
  The header and footer, as defined by the document style, may contain tag
  references in the form %{_name_}. The tags _name_ and _charset_
  are always defined, but a document style may include more. This option allows
  specification of extra values, or overriding of predefined tags. _tag_ must
  have the form _name_=_value_.
  .IP
  Tags in the header or footer that have not been defined will be removed.
  An example of a custom tag is the _css_ tag used in the _separate-css_
  document style of the _html_ output style. This allows insertion of the
  desired CSS style sheet URL into the generated file.
*-v*, *--verbose*::
  Print verbose warning messages.

FILES
=====

libt3highlight, which is used by t3highlight to do the highlighting, and
t3highlight itself look for their data files in the directory
$HOME/.local/share/libt3highlight and /usr/share/libt3highlight_?_ (where _?_
is a digit indicating the binary API version). The documentation on how to
write highlighting patterns and style files is normally installed in
/usr/share/doc/libt3highlight.
