TODO
====
- allow mutiple document names, such that we can allow different headers. This
	would for example allow definition of a HTML4 and HTML5 document
	header/footer in the same style
	- add option to print list of document names
- handle encodings (better)
- merge consecutive sections using the same attribute?
