DESIGN GOALS:
- State should be no more than a single integer
- Highlighting does not have to provide very advanced features, as long as most
	things like comments, strings, keywords and a few other things can be
	highlighted.

TODO:
Library:
- UTF-8 mode
- Add an interface for language detection
	- Support and detect Emacs language identifiers (-*- <name> -*- or something)
		and vi/vim modelines (only first and last 5 lines)
	- Do we wish to support language switching?
- Nested highlighting (see nested.txt)

t3highlight:
- add html/latex/etc escaping of inputs (i.e. sed scripts or something like it)
- merge consecutive sections using the same attribute?

Generic:
- define a list of default style names to use
- convert nano/GNU source-highlight/other highlighting patterns if possible
