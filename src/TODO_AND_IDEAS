DESIGN GOALS:
- State should be no more than a single integer
- Highlighting does not have to provide very advanced features, as long as most
	things like comments, strings, keywords and a few other things can be
	highlighted.

TODO:
Library:
- refactor and comment the code, because it is messy and very unclear. This
  also requires explaining the data structures and their use.
- split highlight.c into smaller units, because it has become to big. Obvious
  candidate for splitting out: the match handling part
- see if using the JIT helps speed things up. Testcase: libtool (a huge shell
  script)
